# Portfolio
In this repository, i have included most of the code that I have written throughout college. 
Some of the programs may be unfinished (namely, the tweet traverser and traveler game files).
The languages used for these programs are split between C++ and Java. 
Also, I have used HTML and CSS to create websites and I am familiar with using Python.
