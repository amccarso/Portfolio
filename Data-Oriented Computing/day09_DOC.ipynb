HOWEVER, RECENTLY SINCE I HAVE HIT OVER 60,000 MILES, MY POWER STEERING LIGHT COMES ON AND THEN I LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE WHEEL IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN.  THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO WRECK ON 4 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  WHEN I TURN THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON, IT GOES AWAY FOR AWHILE, BUT THEN ALWAYS SEEMS TO LOCK BACK UP AGAIN.  YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE ONLY THING YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IS ADD POWER STEERING FLUID, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS CAR DOESN'T HAVE THAT, IT IS ALL ELECTRICAL. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND HAVE NOTICED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THERE ARE IN FACT HUNDREDS, IF NOT MORE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRING.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS AND COSTLY PROBLEM($700-$1500), AND OF COURSE I'M NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY ANYMORE, ALONG WITH ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM.  I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HEADLIGHTS CAN BE RECALLED, BUT SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS YOUR STEERING NOT.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE OVER A FAULTY ELECTRIC POWER STEERING PROBLEM.  I HAVE CALLED A FEW DEALERSHIPS IN MY AREA AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAVE SAID THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASES EXACTLY LIKE MINE, IF THEY NOTICE THIS DEFECT, THEN WHY CAN'T THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE DECISION TO RECALL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. *TR\",\n",

I\\'M SCHEDULED FOR AN APPOINTMENT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND TO LOOK INTO WHY MY VEHICLE STALLED.  ALTHOUGH THEY STATE THIS IS \"VOLUNTARY CUSTOMER STATISFACTION PROGRAM\" I THINK THEY SHOULD JUST CALL IT A RECALL AND HAVE ALL CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED THIS MODEL BRING THEIR VEHICLE IN NOW RATHER THAN WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM.

THEN WHEN COMING UP ON SLOWER TRAFFIC, YOU TOUCH THE BRAKES TO DISENGAGE THE CRUISE CONTROL, A VIOLENT VIBRATION PROCEEDS.  IF YOU APPLY MORE BRAKES THE VIBRATION GETS WORSE.

THEY TOLD US THAT THE ENGINE IS FINE AND IT HAPPENS TO MANY COBALT THAT THE ENGINE LIGHT WILL GO ON SOMETIMES WITHOUT ANY REASON. WE CALLED CHEVROLET AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT HAVE NO SOLUTION TO IT. WE WERE ASKED TO KEEP DRIVING THE CAR WITH ENGINE LIGHT ON. WE FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING A CAR WITH ENGINE LIGHT ON. WE WOULD NOT KNOW IF THERE IS REALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. CHEVROLET REFUSED TO TAKE ANY ACTION REGARDING TO THIS MATTER. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FURTHER HELP ON THIS INCIDENT. THERE IS CURRENTLY 6000 MILES ON THE CAR AND THE ENGINE MAY BE FINE AT THIS MOMENT. BUT SINCE THE ENGINE LIGHT IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY, WE WOULD NOT KNOW IF SOMETHING REALLY HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE. WE DON'T FEEL SAFE BUT NOWHERE TO SEEK HELP.   *JB\",\n",

       "  'Summary': 'I PURCHASED A 2005 CHEVROLET COBALT IN AUGUST OF 2005. IN DECEMBER OF 05 THE CAR WAS HAVING A PROBLEM RELATED TO THE AUTOMATIC SHIFTER AND WAS IN FOR SERVICE. THE SHIFTING UNIT WAS REPLACED, ALSO THE RADIO WAS REPROGRAMMED FOR FLASHING AN ERROR MESSAGE AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. BY FEBRUARY OF 06 THE SHIFTER WAS AGAIN VERY STIFF TO MOVE AND WAS HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION. THE GARAGE ADJUSTED THE SHIFTER LINKAGE AND LUBED THE CABLE ASSEMBLY, AT THIS TIME I ALSO HAD A CONCERN WITH THE OPERATION OF THE HEADLIGHTS, CHANGING THEM FROM LOW BEAM TO HIGH BEAM. THE PROBLEM BEING THAT WHEN YOU SWITCH THE LIGHTS THEY GO OUT FOR A BRIEF TIME. THE GARAGE ORDERED A NEW MULTI-CONTROL SWITCH FOR THE CAR. A FEW DAYS AFTER HAVING THE CAR SERVICED FOR THESE PROBLEMS THE CAR WAS TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE THE KEY AGAIN FROM THE SWITCH CAUSING THE BATTERY TO GO DEAD, AND THE SHIFTER WAS VERY STIFF. THE GARAGE ORDERED AND REPLACED THE SHIFTER ASSEMBLY AND  DEFECTIVE CYLINDER FOR THE KEY SWITCH. AS OF THE 7TH OF MARCH, 06, I WAS STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE LIGHTS GOING OUT WHEN CHANGING FROM LOW TO HIGH BEAMS, THE CAR IS PRESENTLY IN THE SHOP. I HAVE CONTACTED GM ABOUT MY CONCERNS WITH THE SHIFTER AND THE LIGHTS. AFTER I DID THIS, I RECIEVED A CALL FROM THE GM REPRESENTITIVE THAT I HAD SPOKEN WITH ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER FROM THE GARAGE TOLD HIM THAT THIS IS A NORMAL CONDITION FOR THE VEHICLE AND THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.   *NM',\n",

FINALLY, DEALERSHIP TOOK PARTS OUT OF A BRAND NEW VEHICLE, SINCE THERE WERE NO PARTS MADE YET DUE TO IT BEING BRAND NEW, AND REPLACED IT.  BUT, IT STILL MAKES A WHINING WHEN IT IS ON #1 SETTING. THE CD PLAYER WOULD LOCK UP ALL THE TIME AND SIMPLY SAY \"LOCKED\".  ACCORDING TO USER MANUAL, WE ARE ADVISED TO TAKE IT TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY WILL FIX THAT PROBLEM.  UPON TAKING CAR TO DEALERSHIP FOR THAT PROBLEM, THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BECAUSE OF COURSE, IT DID NOT DO IT FOR THEM.  SO, WE STOPPED TRYING TO EVEN USE THE CD PLAYER.  THE LOCKED STATUS OCCURS FREQUENTLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  LIKE, WHEN GOING OVER A REAL BUMPY PART OF THE ROAD.  ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LOCK BUTTON APPEARED ON THE DASHBOARD.  I WAS AFRAID THE CAR WAS GOING TO TURN OFF ON ME.  SOMETIMES THE WORD \"LOCK\" COMES ON IN THE RADIO DISPLAY AND SO THE CLOCK WON\\'T DISPLAY.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS WRONG OR WHY IT IS DISPLAYED.  THE REAL SCARY PART, THOUGH, IS WHEN THE DASHBOARD DISPLAYS THE \"LOCK\" ICON.  BECAUSE I FEAR THAT THE VEHICLE WILL JUST STOP RUNNING SINCE I READ THAT IT DOES HAVE AN ANTI-THEFT FUNCTION THAT WILL STOP THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO THE CAR AND I WONDER IF/WHEN THIS WILL BEGIN MALFUNCTIONING.  WILL I BE ON THE HIGHWAY TRAVELING AT 65 MPS?  I MEAN, MORE PEOPLE NEED TO LET CHEVY KNOW THAT THIS IS HAPPENING SO THAT IT CAN BE FIXED.  \\r\\nLATELY, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT START.  IT JUST WILL NOT START WHEN WE PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION.  ALL OTHER LIGHTS AND THINGS TURN ON, BUT THE ENGINE WON\\'T TURN OVER.  WHY, WE DON\\'T KNOW.  DEALER CLAIMS WE MUST HAVE IT TOWED TO THEM AND NOT GET IT JUMPED SO THEY CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT TO SEE WHAT IS WRONG.  HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES SO FAR.  STILL NO RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  FEEL THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE A RESULT OF THE SAME DEFECT-THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.  GUY THAT CAME TO JUMP MY CAR SAID THE COBALTS HAVE HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS.  *NM',\n",

I TOOK IT IN THREE (3) TIMES AND ON THE FINAL ONE THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO SOLUTION AND THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY GM NOT ONLY IN THE 2005-2006 CHEVY COBALT, THE 2005-2006 PONTIAC PURSUIT, AND THE 2005-2006 SATURN ION. ALL WHICH HAVE THE 2.2L ECOTEC L61 ENGINE. IT TROUBLES ME THAT THEY SAY THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND TO JUST KEEP BRINGING IT IN WHEN LIGHT COMES ON. THAT IS TRULY A PATHETIC ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM. THEY ARE COSTING ME TIME AND MONEY AND THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS. THIS IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE THEY CANT SOLVE AND THAT IS AFFECTING 3 DIFFERENT CARS.

I WAS DRIVING AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 30MPH MAKING A LEFT TURN CROSSING A VERY BUSY LANE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN THE CAR JUST SHUT OFF.  THE RADIO WAS STILL ON BUT IF I PRESSED ON THE GAS, NOTHING.  I HAD TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK, SHUT OFF THE IGNITION AND THEN RESTART IT.  IT IMMEDIATELY STARTED BACK UP. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP RIGHT AWAY AND WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRACE THE PROBLEM AND HOPEFULLY IT WAS A ONE TIME THING.  WELL THEN ABOUT A MONTH LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME TO WAIT ABOUT A WEEK AND CALL BACK, WELL WITHIN A WEEK IT HAPPENED AGAIN SO I CALLED AND TOLD THEM I WAS BRINGING IT TO THEM.  WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN THEY INSTALLED A FLIGHT RECORDER AND SENT ME ON MY WAY.  ABOUT A WEEK LATER THE CAR SHUT OFF AGAIN SO I PRESSED THE BUTTON ON THE FLIGHT RECORDER AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE MECHANICS INFORMED ME THAT THE FLIGHT RECORDER DID NOT WORK BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE ON MY CAR AT THE TIME OF THE INSTALLATION IN ORDER TO MAKE THE RECORDER WORK AND WANTED ME TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO HAVE  THE RECORDER RE-INSTALLED.  I REFUSED AND TOLD THEM I WOULD BRING THE CAR BACK BUT THEY NEEDED TO KEEP IT UNTIL THEY FIGURED OUT THE PROBLEM.  ON MY WAY BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THE CAR SHUT OFF AGAIN WHILE GOING 65MPH ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE DEALERSHIP HAD THE CAR FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND CLAIMED IT WAS FIXED FOR SURE.  THEY SAID THEY FOUND THE PROBLEM AND REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH AND POWER TRAIN RELAY.  WELL I HAVE NOW HAD MY CAR BACK FOR TWO WEEKS AND AS OF LAST NIGHT IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED BECAUSE I REFUSE TO DRIVE IT.  AT THIS POINT I DO NOT WANT THE CAR AND HAVE NO FAITH IN THEM REPAIRING IT.

THE CAR ACTS JUST LIKE YOU TURN OFF THE IGNITION WHILE YOU ARE IN THE DRIVEWAY, EXCEPT YOU ARE DRIVING 70 MPH AND THERE IS TRAFFIC ALL AROUND YOU.  WHEN WE PULL OVER AND PARK THE CAR, THE CAR STARTS RIGHT BACK UP AND DRIVES FINE.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS INDICATING THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE FIRST FAILURE WAS WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES.  SHE TOLD ME THAT THE COBALT TURNED OFF WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING AND HAD TO PULL OVER AND TURN IT BACK ON.  SHE WAS DRIVING AT 75 MPH AND DID NOT HAVE CRUISE CONTROL ON. THE SECOND TIME I WAS DRIVING THE COBALT WITH HER AS A PASSENGER.  WE WERE DRIVING AT 75 MPH FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES WHEN THE CAR TURNED OFF.  WE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM ABOUT IT.  THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE DEFROSTER SWITCH AND UPDATED THE COMPUTER. THE THIRD TIME I WAS DRIVING WITH MY WIFE.  WE WERE DRIVING AT 75 MPH WITH CRUISE ON A REALLY STRAIGHT STRETCH OF HIGHWAY.  I WAS NOT TOUCHING ANYTHING AND WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE WHEN THE CAR TURNED OFF.  I PULLED OVER AND IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALERSHIP DROVE THE CAR FOR 40-45 MILES AND CHECKED THE COMPUTER.  THEY TOLD US THAT THEY SAW NO CODES AND COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THEY GAVE US THE GM CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AND I THEM REGARDING THIS SAFETY CONCERN. GM TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT TO SEE IF THEY COULD DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THIS DEALERSHIP ONLY DROVE THE CAR 8 MILES AND TOLD US THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TIME TO SPEND DRIVING THE VEHICLE LONGER.  I CALLED GM AGAIN, THE ADM OF THE AREA PASSED ON TO US THAT, SINCE THE PROBLEM CANNOT BE DUPLICATED, THE ONLY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS TO 1) ATTACH A FLIGHT RECORDER TO THE VEHICLE AND CONTINUE DRIVING IT IN HOPES THAT THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES AND WE CAN CATCH IT WITH THE FLIGHT RECORDER OR 2) TAKE A SERVICE MAN ON A ROAD TRIP TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM DUPLICATES. *JB',\n",

AS THE CAR WAS CONTINUING TO ACCELERATE I TRIED BRAKING BUT THE CAR WAS STILL ACCELERATING WHILE IT WAS BRAKING AT THE SAME TIME.  I WAS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO A CAR AHEAD OF ME.  I WAS GETTING REAL CLOSE WHEN I PUT THE GEAR INTO NEUTRAL AND I TRIED BRAKING , BUT IT WAS HARD TO PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE CAR FINALLY SLOWED DOWN AND I MANAGED TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  WHEN I WAS PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE CAR ENGINE WAS STILL RACING AND THE RPMS  WERE STILL AT 4.  I PUT THE GEAR IN PARK) AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE.  I TRIED RESTARTING THE CAR, BUT INITIALLY IT WOULDN'T START.  I WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THE CAR STARTED.  THIS MALFUNCTION ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM BEHIND AT 90 MPH!  I DROVE HOME AT 50-55 MPH, AFRAID TO GO FASTER THAN 55 MPH.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP/REPAIR SHOP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR, AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS ONLY THE FLOOR MAT THAT GOT CAUGHT ON THE GAS PEDAL.  AFTER, I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AFTER THE INCIDENT  I CHECKED THE FLOOR MAT, BUT IT WAS NO WHERE NEAR THE GAS PEDAL, AND WHY WOULD THE GAS PEDAL FALL INTO THE FLOOR IF THE FLOOR MAT WAS IN THE WAY?  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE  THE CAR , AND AM NOW RENTING A CAR TO COMMUTE TO AND FROM WORK.  I CALLED OTHER AUTO REPAIR SHOPS,  AND THEY INDICATED THAT I SHOULD NOT  BRING  THE CAR IN UNTIL IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  THIS INCIDENT ALMOST CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT!

IT STILL LEAKS TO THIS DAY AND I GET CONDENSATION ON THE DASHBOARD WHEN IT S HOT ENOUGH. MY RADIO HAS SHORTED OUT TWICE FROM THIS PROBLEM.

TWICE IN THE LAST WEEK, WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON THE INTERSTATE DOING APPROX 60 MPH,  WARNING CHIMES SOUNDED AND SECONDS LATER A \"POWER STEERING\" AND \"LOW TRACTION\" LIGHTS APPEARED.  STEERING BECAME ALL BUT INOPERABLE, CAR BECAME EXTREMELY HARD TO HANDLE AND CAR \"SHOOK\".  UPON STOPPING AND RESTARTING THE CAR, THINGS WENT BACK TO NORMAL.  HIS COMMENT WAS THAT IF SOME \"OLD FEEBLE PERSON\" WAS DRIVING, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT.  LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS WEBSITES,  THIS IS A VERY WELL KNOWN PROBLEM TO CHEVROLET (GENERAL MOTORS) IN THAT THE NEW \"ELECTRIC POWER STEERING\"  IS PRONE TO FAILURE.  DOZENS (HUNDREDS) OF PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS AND CHEVROLET\\'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN THAT IF THEY CAN\\'T FIND A \"CODE\" TO POINT TO A STEERING FAILURE, THEN THERE MUST NOT BE A PROBLEM.  CURRENTLY THE CAR HAS BEEN WITH BOEMLER CHEVROLET IN ARNOLD, MISSOURI  MONDAY 7/28 AND TODAY TUESDAY 7/29.  MONDAY AFTERNOON THEY CALLED AND SAID THEY WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT ANOTHER DAY SINCE THEY COULD NOT GET IT TO FAIL AND COULDN\\'T GET A \"CODE\" TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.   MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE WEBSITES, CUSTOMERS HAVE SAID THAT THE STEERING COLUMN HAD TO BE REPLACED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.   THIS PROBLEM HAS CAUSED OTHER CUSTOMERS TO HAVE ACCIDENTS ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ.  I DON\\'T KNOW IF THEY\\'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO READ THEIR OWNER\\'S MANUAL TO GET THE PROPER PEOPLE TO COMPLAIN TO.  I REALIZE THAT COMPLAINING ON SOME WEBSITE IS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, AND THAT IT MUST BE DONE THROUGH PROPER CHANNELS.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BY CHEVROLET (GM) BEFORE MORE PEOPLE GET HURT OR WORSE.  I THINK A VOLUNTARY RECALL ON THEIR PART WOULD LOOK A LOT BETTER THAN HAVING A \"CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT\" FILED AGAINST THEM.   *TR',\n",

ON 09/23/2008, WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT AT APPROX. 30 MPH ON A BUSY ROAD (2 LANES EACH DIRECTION), SAME THING HAPPENED (CHIME, \"POWER STEERING\" DISPLAY, LOSS OF POWER STEERING, DIFFICULTY STEERING THE CAR); SLOWED TO A STOP ON APPROACH TO A RED LIGHT, PUT CAR IN PARK, TURNED CAR OFF, RE-STARTED CAR, BACK TO NORMAL.  ON 09/26/2008 (TODAY), WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT ON A CITY STREET AT APPROX. 20 MPH, SAME THING HAPPENED (CHIME, \"POWER STEERING\" DISPLAY, LOSS OF POWER STEERING, DIFFICULTY STEERING THE CAR), NO PLACE TO PULL OVER, HAD TO TURN LEFT ON A SIDE STREET TO PARK, VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE CAR WHILE MAKING THE TURN, PARKED, TURNED CAR OFF, RE-STARTED CAR, BACK TO NORMAL.  I HAVE AN UPCOMING SERVICE APPOINTMENT AT MY CHEVY DEALERSHIP, BUT SERVICE DEPARTMENT ADVISES ME THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE, AND THEY WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO FIND/FIX PROBLEM IF IT OCCURS WHILE IT IS IN THEIR POSSESSION, AND I AM OUT OF WARRANTY (44,000 MILES ON ODOMETER).  I AM NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR, BUT HAVE NO OTHER WAY TO GET TO WORK AND BACK.  I WILL NOT DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY.  I DID AN INTERNET SEARCH ON 09/23/2008, AND SEE COMPLAINT AFTER COMPLAINT FROM COBALT OWNERS ABOUT THIS VERY SAME PROBLEM.  ALSO SEE THAT THERE WAS A \"SPECIAL COVERAGE ADJUSTMENT\" (DATED 12/03/2007) FOR 2005 CHEVY MALIBUS AND 2005 PONTIAC G6S FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME POWER STEERING PROBLEM (REMEDY FOR THIS WAS FOR DEALER TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY; SPECIAL COVERAGE WAS FOR 7 YEARS OR 70,000 MILES).  DRIVING A CAR THAT SUDDENLY LOSES POWER STEERING ON AN ON-GOING BASIS IS NOT SAFE, WHY IS THERE NO RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM FOR COBALTS? *TR',\n",

MY HUSBAND VEERED OFF THE ROAD BECAUSE IT WAS HARD TO STEER, WE THEN TURNED THE CAR OFF HOPING IT WOULD CLEAR THE ERROR. WE STARTED THE CAR AND IT THEN DROVE FINE. WHEN WE GOT TO WHERE WE WERE GOING WE DECIDED TO CHECK THE POWER STEERING FLUID BUT COULDN\\'T FIND WHERE IT WAS. WE LOOKED IN OUR OWNER¿S MANUAL AND IT STATED THAT IT WAS ELECTRICAL AND THERE WAS NO FLUID. THE NEXT DAY ON THE INTERSTATE AT 60 MPH DRIVING TO WORK THE WARNING LIGHT WENT OFF AND IT READ, \"POWER STEERING\", MY HUSBAND MAINTAINED CONTROL AND IT NEVER REGAINED POWER STEERING. FROM THAT INCIDENT ON EVERY TIME WE DROVE IT KEPT HAPPENING AND WE WOULD NEVER REGAIN POWER STEERING UNTIL WE TURNED THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTED IT. FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING 9/8/08 WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY TOLD US THERE WAS AN INTERNAL FAULT IN THE STEERING COLUMN MOTOR AND THEY NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ELECTRONIC COLUMN. I ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL BECAUSE I FOUND HUNDREDS OF INCIDENTS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WITH OUR SAME VEHICLE, MAKE AND YEAR ON THE INTERNET. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THIS IS THE FIRST THEY HAD HEARD OF. I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THAT WHEN THEY REPLACED MY MOTOR I WANTED THE FAULTY ONE BACK. THEY GOT AN ATTITUDE QUICKLY AND TOLD ME THAT I COULDN\\'T HAVE THE OLD PART BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER GM WARRANTY. I THEN ASKED IF THAT\\'S THE CASE THEN WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS NEW PART BECAUSE MY OLD ONE IS OBVIOUSLY FAULTY. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS PART OF GM POLICY AND I COULD NOT HAVE THE OLD PART. AFTER THAT IT MADE US VERY SUSPICIOUS AS TO WHY THEY WOULDN\\'T LET US TAKE THE OLD PART. I TOLD THEM THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE ENDANGERING PEOPLE\\'S LIVES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. I CONTACTED THE GM CORPORATE OFFICE AND THEY GAVE ME THE SAME SPILL THAT THEY HAVEN¿T HEARD OF THIS ISSUE. *TR',\n",

LAST WEEK WHEN DRIVING NEAR HOME I REC\\'D A SUDDEN FLASHING MESSAGE ON THE DASH \"POWER STEERING.\" IMMEDIATELY, THE STEERING FAILED COMPLETELY. IT TOOK ALL MY STRENGTH TO TURN THE VEHICLE AND  I WAS ONLY GOING 20 MILES PER HOUR - HAD IT BEEN DIFFERENT - AND AS I\\'VE SINCE FOUND IT THIS HAS OCCURRED THOUSANDS OF TIMES TO OTHER DRIVERS OF THIS CAR -  IT COLD HAVE KILLED ME. MY LOCAL DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE ENTIRE STEERING MECHANISM HAD TO BE REPLACED - RATHER ODD FOR A CAR, PERFECTLY MAINTAINED, WITH SO FEW MILES ON IT!  THE HEAD TECHNICIAN AT MY DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE 2005 AND 2006 COBALT\\'S STEERING MECHANISM. BOTH RELIED ENTIRELY ON AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM THAT CAN FAIL INSTANTLY AND LEAVE THE CAR WITH NO STEERING CONTROL - WHILE IT\\'S BEING DRIVEN! THE REPAIRS WERE LARGELY COVERED BY MY EXTENDED WARRANTY - I\\'VE HAD IT FOR 38 MONTHS. (REPAIR COPY: \"INTERNAL MOTOR FAILURE.\" AND \"REPLACE STEERING COLUMN\" = $804.00) BUT, AS THE REPAIR SERVICE ITSELF NOTED, THIS JUST RESTORES THE SAME, READY TO FAIL SYSTEM!  THE PROBLEM CAN\\'T BE FIXED BECAUSE IT\\'S A BASIC DESIGN FLAW! ACCORDING TO THE HEAD TECHNICIAN, BEGINNING IN ABOUT 2007, THE COBALT WAS ALTERED TO INCLUDE A BACK-UP HYDRAULIC STEERING MECHANISM TO MAKE UP FOR THIS RECOGNIZED PROBLEM. THERE ARE OVER 12,600 LISTS OF THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET TODAY, SOME NOTING THAT A SECOND FAILURE OCCURRED ONLY TWO WEEKS AFTER HAVING THE SAME \"REPAIRS\" THAT I HAD.

SOME DAYS IT WILL FAIL UP TO 4 TIMES, AND THEN IT MAY GO A WEEK OR TWO WITHOUT FAILING.  IT DOES SEEM TO OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY IN WARMER WEATHER.  I AM OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED BECAUSE THE FAILURE OF POWER STEERING IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN OR WHILE DRIVING AT HIGH SPEEDS COULD CERTAINLY BE FATAL FOR NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT ANY OTHER DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS INVOLVED.  I AM EXTREMELY UPSET BY THE FACT THAT CHEVY WILL NOT REPLACE THIS ELECTRONIC PART AT NO COST TO ME SINCE I DO NOT CONSIDER IT NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ON THE CAR.  I FIND THIS TO BE MORE AN ISSUE OF CHEVROLET USING A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY PART FOR THE CAR.  THEY HAVE RESPONDED THAT MY WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER IT.  I'VE RESEARCHED NUMEROUS FORUMS AND IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM IN MY 2005 COBALT BUT ONE FACED BY AT LEAST 100-200 OTHERS.

FIRST NOTICED TRACTION CONTROL AND POWER STEERING LIGHT COMING ON-THE CAR \"BUCKS\" AND POWER STEERING IS LOST-SEVERAL TIMES CAR WILL LOSE POWER AND HAVE TO BE RESTART. AFTER RESTART WARNING LIGHTS WILL GO AWAY AND POWER STEERING RETURNS.  SEEMS TO COME BACK TO NORMAL AFTER RESTART, RUNS OK UNTIL THE PROCESS STARTS AGAIN.  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED MAY 08 AND FIRST INCIDENT WAS AUG 15 2008-TOOK TO DEALER AND THEY RESET THE COMPUTER, SECOND AND THIRD TIME THE CAR SEEMED OK UNTIL THE 4TH INCIDENT AND RETURNED TO DEALER AGAIN AND RESET AGAIN.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE COMPUTER CODES WERE SHOWING U2105 AND U2100 U2107  AND CAR RETURNED. THIS LAST INCIDENT (12-11-08) THE CAR WAS DOING THE SAME THING AND DROVE RIGHT TO DEALER TO SHOW SERVICE WHAT THE CAR WAS DOING.  THEY CLAIMED THE CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH ELECTRIC STEERING COLUMN AND IT DISENGAGES FROM THE COMPUTER AND THE STEERING COLUMN NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND A COMPUTER MODULE.  GAVE THEM PERMISSION TO CORRECT THIS BECAUSE I CAN\\'T LET MY SON DRIVE A CAR KNOWING AT ANYTIME HE WILL LOSE POWER STEERING. HE HAS BEEN LUCKY HE WAS TRAVELING AT  LOW SPEEDS WHEN THIS  OCCURS.  IF HE WAS ON A HIGHWAY AND IN FRONT OF A TRACTOR TRAILER AND LOST POWER HE MIGHT BE KILLED BECAUSE HE WOULD LOSE PS AND STALL.  THIS IS A  SAFETY-RELATED DEFECT IN THE VEHICLE EQUIPMENT (ELECTRIC POWER STEERING COLUMN) WHEN AT ANY TIME WITH NO WARNING YOU CAN LOSE YOUR STEERING, STALL AND/OR BUCK. UPON FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE 2005 COBALT,  I HAVE FOUND 805 COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE STEERING COLUMN AND THE PROBLEMS OF CONTROLLING THE CAR WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH THE MALIBU IS HAVING THE SAME ISSUES WITH STEERING.  GUESS WHAT KIND OF STEERING IS IN THE MALIBU. CHECK \"WWW.ABOUTAUTOMOBILE.COM\" FOR COMPLAINTS REGARDING STEERING COLUMN.  SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED INCIDENTS WHERE THEIR SAFETY WAS COMPROMISED. PLEASE HELP GM REP CLAIMS CAN\\'T RECALL COLUMN WITHOUT YOU. PLEASE HELP *TR',\n",

THE NEW FUEL TANK, (TANK AND HOSE ONE ITEM), ALSO HAS NO CLAMP AT THE FUEL TANK.  IN ADDITION TO ALLOWING EXPLOSIVE VAPORS INTO THE AIR, THE COST OF THE REPAIR IS HUGE.  THE TANK ASSEMBLY, (THE HOSE AND FUEL TANK ARE ONE ITEM), IS $500, PLUS INSTALLATION.  CHEVY AND GM WERE NOTIFIED AND I WAS TOLD, \"THE PARTS ARE OFF THE VEHICLE AND NOTHING WILL BE DONE ABOUT THIS.\"  TO FIND THIS DEFECT, THE PARTS , (TANK), MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE CAR HAS 45000 MILES AND HAS NEVER BEEN IN A CRASH OR HAD ANY DAMAGE TO IT.  THIS HOSE HAS NO TENSION ON IT, JUST THE LACK OF A CLAMP ALLOWING IT TO COME LOOSE.  THE GASOLINE VAPORS ESCAPING FROM THE TANK IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, LIKE A GARAGE, COULD LEAD TO AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE, (I\\'M A RETIRED FIREFIGHTER).  DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT BY ESCAPING GASOLINE VAPORS ALSO OCCURS, (THAT\\'S WHY THE HOSE IS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE).  THIS NEGLIGENCE IN THE DESIGN ON THE PART OF GM COULD BE CORRECTED WITH A SIMPLE LOW COST CLAMP ON THE HOSE.  THIS DEFECT CAUSES THE CONSUMER TO SPEND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY NEEDLESSLY, EXPOSES THE ENVIRONMENT TO GASOLINE VAPOR DAMAGE AND COULD POTENTIALLY EXPLODE, KILLING SOMEONE.

AFTER THAT POINT IT IS ONLY MANUAL DRIVE. THERE ARE WEBSITES AND BLOGS THAT ARE DEDICATED JUST TO THIS PROBLEM INCLUDING HTTP://WWW.TOPIX.COM/FORUM/AUTOS/CHEVROLET-COBALT/T8FMSUQB7V2DTH5JH.\\r\\nTHIS SITE HAS 335 INSTANCES OF THIS PROBLEM AS OF TODAY. GM HAS FAILED TO STEP UP AND FIX THIS. IN FACT, THEY INSIST THAT THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN MUST BE REPLACED. HOWEVER, THIS SITE HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/CHEVROLET/COBALT/2005/STEERING/POWER_STEERING_FAILURE.SHTML SHOWS THAT IT IS USUALLY ONLY ONE COMPONENT BUT THAT  COMPONENT CANNOT BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY. THE ENTIRE COLUMN REPLACEMENT RUNS FROM $800 TO $2000 WHEREAS THE COMPONENT ALONE HAS TO BE MUCH CHEAPER AND IS ACTUALLY SIMPLE TO REPLACE. I TRIED THE REMEDY LISTED BY WAYNE FROM ZION IL #318 ON THE FIRST WEBSITE LISTED HERE AND WHILE IT DIDN\\'T WORK FOR ME, THERE WAS SO MUCH BLACK POWDER COMING OUT OF IT I COULDN\\'T BELIEVE IT. NO WONDER IT DOESN\\'T WORK! THIS PART IS BASICALLY SEALED SO IT MUST BE MADE IN UNCLEAN CONDITIONS. I BELIEVE IT IS MADE IN JAPAN (ONE OF THE POSTS MENTIONS IT). I BELIEVE THAT POWER STEERING ISSUES ARE A MAJOR DEFECT AND WHY NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE BY THIS ORGANIZATION OR GM IS BEYOND ME. WHILE IT MAY BE SAFE TO DRIVE IN MANUAL STEERING, HAVING IT CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN (AS IS REPORTED IN THE POSTS) IS NOT SAFE!\\r\\n\\r\\nANOTHER PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO BE RELATED IS THE KEY NOT COMING OUT OF THE IGNITION. I SAY RELATED BECAUSE MOST CARS WITH THE FIRST ISSUE SEEM TO HAVE THE SECOND ISSUE TOO.\\r\\n\\r\\nLASTLY, THESE CARS ALSO HAVE THE A/C LEAK DIRECTLY INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT CAUSING MOLD AND MILDEW AND THEREFORE UNSAFE BREATHING CONDITIONS IN THE CAR. CHECK THE POSTS, DEALERS \"CAN\\'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG\" WITH THEM.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW DO I FORCE YOUR ORGANIZATION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AS I KNOW I\\'M NOT THE ONLY ONE TO COMPLAIN? *TR\\r\\n',\n",

THEY HAVE THE CAR NOW BECAUSE ON 8/10/09, I NEARLY GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT AND HAD TO JUMP THE CURB IN ORDER TO AVOID GETTING HIT BECAUSE I COULDN'T MAKE A LEFT TURN INTO TRAFFIC. I THEN SUFFERED A SEVERE ANXIETY ATTACK AND NEEDED ASSISTANCE FROM FAMILY MEMBERS TO COME PICK ME UP AND GET THE CAR TOWED BACK UP TO THE DEALERSHIP. I AM ONLY 19 YEARS OLD, & THIS IS MY FIRST CAR. ALL I WANT IS SOMETHING SAFE TO DRIVE SO I CAN GO TO SCHOOL, WORK, AND PERFORM MY OTHER TASKS ALIVE AND IN ONE PIECE, PLEASE HELP THOSE OF US EXPERIENCING THESE PROBLEM TO GET GM TO PROVIDE A RECALL ON THESE CARS. I LOVE THIS CAR, BUT IT IS NOT WORTH LOSING MY LIFE OVER. I HAVE PAID A TOTAL OF $938.00 ON THE STEERING COLUMN & $138.00 FOR TOWING EXPENSES. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP, & I CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER CAR. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION,\\r\\n\\r\\nANDREA JOHNSON *TR\",\n",

I EXITED THE FREEWAY AND PULLED INTO A GAS STATION AND SHUT THE CAR OFF.  I COULD NOT FIND THE POWER STEERING OIL RESERVOIR TO CHECK MY LEVELS.  GOT IN MY CAR AND THE POWER STEERING WAS JUST FINE.  OVER THE NEXT WEEK, IT WENT OUT 4 TO 5 TIMES RANDOMLY.  I CHECKED THE WEB FOR THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT IT IS AN INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRIC MOTOR GM PUT INTO THIS VEHICLE (PLUS OTHER MODELS).  SINCE IT STARTED, IT GOES OUT ANYWHERE FROM ONCE A DAY TO 7-10 DAYS A DAY.  THE PROBLEM IS COMPLETELY RANDOM.  AFTER FINDING OUT THAT MANY OTHER COBALT OWNERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, AND THE FACT THAT IT IS A DANGER TO OPERATE WHEN IT SUDDENLY GOES OUT, I FEEL THAT GM NEEDS TO DO A RECALL ON THIS MOTOR.

THE NEXT DAY MY HUSBAND TRIED CALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE AT GM CORPORATE, WHO REFUSED TO LOOK AT OUR PROBLEM (THE SECOND TIME THIS PROBLEM HAD OCCURRED IN OUR CAR IN THE 4 YEARS/52,000 MILES WE HAD OWNED THE CAR. THEY REFUSED TO HELP OR EVEN DISCUSS OUR PROBLEM, NOT SEEING IT AS AN ISSUE AT ALL.

CHEVY HAS NOT PERFECTED THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING BUT PUT IT IN EVERY CHEVROLET COBALT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN. IT MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN INSTALLED FOR THE 2005 AND 2006 MODELS. YOU MAY START YOUR VEHICLE AND HAVE EVERYTHING RUNNING OKAY UNTIL YOU DRIVE IT FOR A LITTLE WHY, THUS LEADING UP TO LOSS OF POWER STEERING. I PROMISE YOU THAT ANYONE THAT HAS BOUGHT A CHEVROLET COBALT BETWEEN 2005 AND 2006 FOR SURE HAVE HAD THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM. EVERY PERSON! THE PROBLEM IS CONSISTENTLY GETTING WORSE AND IS HIGHLY UNSAFE. THIS CAN NOT BE DELT WITH BY TAKING IT INTO A GARAGE AND HOPING IT WILL GET FIXED.\\r\\n3.

WHEN STARTING THE CAR, POWERSTEERING WOULD ONLY STAY ON FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. TO REGAIN IT I WOULD HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE VEHICLE AND RESTART IT. THIS LASTED ABOUT THREE MONTHS. IT WAS TAKEN TO TWO DIFFERENT SHOPS, SEARS AND A CAR DEALERSHIP AND BOTH RAN DIAGNOSTICS WHICH FOUND NOTHING WRONG. THEY COULD NOT TELL ME WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS FOR SURE EXCEPT TO SAY PERHAPS PUTTING IN A WHOLE NEW POWER STEERING SYSTEM WOULD HELP. THOUGH THEY DID NOT KNOW FOR SURE. WHEN I CALLED THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP THEMSELVES THEY STATED THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE POWERSTEERING IN THAT YEAR AND MODEL AND WANTED TO RUN THEIR OWN DIAGNOSTICS, THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR. I REFUSED SINCE THE SECOND DEALER I TOOK THE CAR TO WAS A CHEVY DEALER AND WAS TOLD BY THE COMPANY I HAD TO PAY FOR ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC CHECK. THE PROBLEM DISAPPEARED IN JULY OF 09 ONLY TO COME BACK NOW DEC 09. THE CARS POWERSTEERING IS OFF WITHIN A MINUTE OF ENGINE START. WITH THE SNOWY WEATHER THIS IS A HAZARD TO ME AND ANYONE ELSE WITH SIMILAR ISSUES; AND I HAVE CHRONIC BACK PROBLEMS AS WELL. THE PULLING OF THE STEERING WHEEL JUST TO TURN THE CAR HAS HAD ME IN BEDREST TWICE NOW. *TR',\n",

I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO A GM DEALER WHO THEN TOLD ME THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE COBALT AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME OVER 800 TO FIX AND THAT IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY . I COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY THEM THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY AFTER JUST PURCHASING THE VEHICLE AND BEING A STUDENT IN SCHOOL . I THEN FOUND A MECHANIC THAT PUT THE PART IN FOR A CHEAPER PRICE BUT STILL ENDED UP COSTING ME 450.00. I WAS RELIEVED TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED WHEN I WAS DRIVING MY CAR TODAY NOT EVEN 6 MONTHS LATER ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN I HEARD THE SAME BEEPING NOISE AND ON MY SCREEN IT CAME UP POWER STEERING!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS TIME I COULD NOT SAFELY PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD I HAD TO KEEP DRIVING TO THE NEAREST EXIT AND MYSELF AND MY GIRLFRIEND USED ALL OF OUR STRENGTH JUST TO TURN THE WHEEL TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY EXIT...THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND VERY COSTLY I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN HOPES TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE A FAIR DISTANCE BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOL WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT SAFETY PROBLEMS SUCH AS THIS. IM AFRAID THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE T HAPPEN EVERY 6 MONTHS AND ONE OF THESE TIMES IM NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP SAFELY.

I FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET THAT FIXED, THINKING THAT THE BRAKE LIGHT AND THE RADIO WAS NOT RELATED, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING IN THE CAR IS ELECTRICAL.  AFTER THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED, I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK, ON THE INTERSTATE, AND AS I EXITED THE INTERSTATE TO COMMUTE TO MY HOME, \"POWER STEERING\" FLASH ON MY DASHBOARD AND MY WHEEL JERKED.  NOW, I WAS TURNING THE WHEEL AND EXITING THE INTERSTATE MERGING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  WHILE EXITING AND MERGING, I WAS GOING ACROSS AN OVERPASS OVER THE INTERSTATE AND CAME LIFE-FLASHING CLOSE TO HITTING THE BRIDGE.  THANK GOODNESS I MAINTAINED CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE.

THE WARRANTY WAS ALREADY UP BUT I TOOK TO A SHOP MY FAMILY HAS TAKEN ITS CARS FOR YEARS. THE SHOP WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM - THEY EVEN TOOK A SPECIFIC CLASS ON MY CAR AND WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSIS IT. TO DATE, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CONTINUES TO GO ON AND OFF. MOST RECENTLY, IT CAME ON AND SO DID A \"POWER STEERING\" MESSAGE. IMMEDIATELY AFTER, MY STEERING LOCKED UP AND BECAME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER. THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT THERE WAS NO WARNING AND IT BEING WINTER THERE WAS ICE EVERYWHERE. I FOUND MYSELF SLIDING ACROSS THE FREE WAY. I DIDN\\'T THINK I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE BUT THANKFULLY MADE IT HOME. THANK GOD, NOT CHEVROLET. IT IS GOING TO COST OVER $2000 TO FIX IT OUT OF MY OWN POCKET AND I\\'M JUST NOT WILLING TO DO SO UNTIL I KNOW FOR SURE THAT CHEVROLET WILL NOT BE RECALLING IT. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ONLINE, I AM ONE OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS EXACT PROBLEM. MANY HAVE ACTUALLY SEND PETITIONS OUT. THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE AND IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT CHEVROLET WILL NOT RECALL THIS BUT WILL RECALL THEIR HEADLIGHTS?! I COULDN\\'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT WHEN I READ IT. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM THE DEALERSHIP HERE LOCALLY OR THE MAIN PHONE NUMBER FOR CHEVROLET. I\\'M JUST PUT ON HOLD. I\\'M A RESPONSIBLE, SINGLE WOMAN WITH A MORTGAGE AND I NEED A RELIABLE CAR. I GUARANTEE I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CHEVROLET SINCE I FOUND OUT THIS IS THE WAY THEY TREAT THEIR CONSUMERS. WHAT\\'S WORSE IS THAT IT IS NOT JUST MY PARTICULAR YEAR OR MODEL, EVERY PERSON I\\'VE TALKED TO READ ABOUT HAS A DIFFERENT YEAR AND SOME ARE THE FOUR DOUR SEDAN OR NORMAL COUPE. THIS MEANS THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE POWER STEERING WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE SINCE CHEVROLET IS CONTINUING TO BUILD THEIR COBALTS AT SUCH A LOW STANDARD. I\\'M INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED.

I BOUGHT THE 2005 CHEVROLET COBALT LS BRAND NEW IN SPRING OF 2005 AND THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT THIS WEEK (JAN 2010).  AS ONE WOULD EXPECT, WHEN IT WENT OUT WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH ON A STRAIGHT CITY STREET IT BECAME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STEER.  MAKING IT A VERY DANGEROUS SAFETY HAZARD IF ONE HAS TO TURN QUICKLY TO AVOID A COLLISION WITH ANOTHER CAR, A PERSON, OR A CHILD. I THOUGHT THAT IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN OUT OF STEERING FLUID, BUT THIS MODEL HAS ELECTRIC POWER STEERING, REQUIRING THE CAR TO BE BROUGHT IN FOR SERVICE.  AFTER ENCOUNTERING THE PROBLEM, I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND THEY STATED THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM VERY FREQUENTLY AND NOTED THAT IT INDEED WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE POWER STEERING MOTOR.  AFTER FINDING OUT HOW COMMON THIS ISSUE WAS, I RESEARCHED ONLINE TO SEE IF PERHAPS GM/CHEVROLET HAD ISSUED A SAFETY RECALL AND TO MY SURPRISE I FOUND OVER 700 COMPLAINTS (ON ONE SITE) FROM COBALT OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE DATING AS FAR BACK AS 2007 (SITE: HTTP://WWW.TOPIX.COM/FORUM/AUTOS/CHEVROLET-COBALT/T8FMSUQB7V2DTH5JH) , BUT NO SAFETY RECALL.  THIS ISSUE IS WELL KNOWN TO GM/CHEVROLET AND YET AND STILL NO RECALL.  THESE PARTICULAR MODELS (CHEVY COBALT LS AND OTHERS) ARE MARKETED AS GREAT CARS FOR TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS, MAKING THE POWER STEERING DEFECT ALL THE MORE DANGEROUS WHEN COMBINED WITH YOUNG DRIVERS.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS LISTED ONLINE AND THERE IS EVEN A PETITION IN PLACE TO REQUIRE GM/CHEVROLET TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL.  ON BEHALF OF OWNERS OF THE EFFECTED MODELS, PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS.  I MYSELF WILL BE KEEPING RECORDS OF THE COMPLAINTS POSTED ONLINE AND I ENCOURAGE OTHERS HAVING THE SAME ISSUE TO DO THE SAME. I WILL ALSO BE CONTACTING GM/CHEVROLET ABOUT THE ISSUE.  PLEASE DON'T OVERLOOK THIS.  ALL 2005 COBALT LS OWNERS ARE AT RISK.

THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING WHAT SO EVER. THE CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING GREAT UNTIL THIS. ONCE I SHUT OFF THE CAR AND LET IT SIT FOR AWHILE I WILL GET THE POWER STEERING BACK BUT WITHIN A DAY OR 2 IT HAPPENS AGAIN. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS TO BE DRIVING AND LOSE THE POWER STEERING WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING. I HAVEN'T FIXED THE CAR YET SO I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO COST BUT I WAS TOLD BY THE GARAGE THAT THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN TO FIX IT. I LOVE MY COBALT BUT I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY THIS JUST FAILED AND IT HAPPENED 3,000 MILES AFTER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY EXPIRED.

THE POWER STEERING MOTOR HAD FRIED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF THE MODULE WAS BAD TOO. THE MOTOR COST ME $411 AND IF THE MODULE HAD GONE TOO IT WOULD HAVE COST $732.

IT WILL FAIL AT ANY SPEED AND IN A CURVE OR ON A STRAIGHT ROAD. I\\'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR ABOUT FIVE WEEKS NOW. THE FIRST WEEK IT DID IT ONCE A DAY, THE SECOND WEEK IT ONLY FAILED ONCE. THE FOLLOWING TWO WEEKS IT WOULD FAIL ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY SECONDS TO ONE HOUR FROM STARTING THE VEHICLE. THE FIFTH WEEK I ONLY DROVE IT ONCE AND THE POWER STEERING STOPPED WORKING IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHARP CORNER ON A COUNTRY ROAD AND I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR PULLED OUT OF A DITCH. IF I SHUT THE CAR OFF AND RESTART IT THE POWER STEERING WORKS AGAIN. MAYBE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, MAYBE FOR ONLY FIVE SECONDS. THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON FOR THE TIMING OF THE FAILURES. AFTER THE SECOND DAY I CALLED THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR. THEY SAID THAT IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE COBALT AND SAID THAT THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN WOULD NEED REPLACED WITH A PRICE BETWEEN $1500.00 AND $2200.00. VERY PRICEY! THEN AFTER THE FIRST WEEK I SEARCHED \"CHEVY COBALT POWER STEERING\" ON THE INTERNET, AND WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT I SAW. OVER ONE HUNDRED HITS ON THE ISSUE WITH PAGE AFTER PAGE OF HORROR STORIES OF THE SAME PROBLEM WITH POWER STEERING FAILURE. SO THIS ISSUE IS HARDLY UNKNOWN. AND WITH TONIGHT\\'S MENTION OF IT ON THE CBS NIGHTLY NEWS, IT WILL HOPEFULLY GAIN SOME MORE ATTENTION. PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS END UP LIKE THE TOYOTA RECALL AND LET PEOPLE DIE BEFORE IT GETS FIXED, BECAUSE IT\\'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.  I HAVE SINCE STOPPED DRIVING THE VEHICLE THAT I STILL OWE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS ON, AND HAVE BEEN BORROWING RIDES FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY. BEING IN THE SAME POSITION HAS 14.8% OF AMERICA, UNEMPLOYED, THERE IS NO WAY THAT I CAN CURRENTLY AFFORD THE COST OF THE REPAIR.

WHEN THAT HAPPENS, THERE IS NO POWER STEERING. I PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, TURN OFF THE CAR AND RESTART THE CAR AND THE POWER STEERING RESUMES. ON 1/12/2010 I DROVE THIS CAR TO TOPEKA, KANSAS AND HAD NO PROBLEMS GOING THERE WHICH WAS 80 MILES. ON THE WAY BACK HOME, THE POWER STEERING QUIT WORKING 7 TIMES IN A 60 MILE. TOWARDS THE END OF THE 60 MILE DRIVE, THE POWER STEERING WOULD GO OUT WITHIN 5 SECONDS OF RESTARTING THE CAR AND DRIVING LESS THAN 100 FEET.

THE POWER STEERING IS PROBLEM IS VERY INTERMITTENT, IT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC SEVERAL TIMES IN ONE DAY AND THEN NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

UNFORTUNATELY THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE GETTING MORE FREQUENT.  I WENT TO A CHEVY DEALER AND THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME $100 TO HOOK IT UP TO A COMPUTER TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. WITH THIS MANY COMPLAINTS, THERE SHOULD BE NO CHARGE TO HOOK THE CAR UP TO A COMPUTER TO DETERMINE WHAT IS WRONG. OUT OF FRUSTRATION, I PARKED THE CAR AND STARTED USING AN OLDER CAR FOR WORK.

THERE WAS A CLICKING NOISE THAT CAME FROM THE SHIFTER (WHERE YOU PUT IT IN PARK, REVERSE, DRIVE). THE CAR STARTED TO JERK FORWARD AT RANDOM & THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK. I PULLED OVER AS SOON AS I COULD & TURNED OFF THE CAR. AFTER LETTING IT SIT FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON & IT HAD RESET ITSELF. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND BROUGHT THE CAR TO THEM IMMEDIATELY. THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR 3 WEEKS & WERE UNABLE TO GET THE CAR TO ACT UP WHILE ON THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST. THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO. I HAD NUMEROUS EPISODES OVER THE NEXT 6 MONTHS INCLUDING MULTIPLE TIMES WHEN I WAS DRIVING BETWEEN 60-70 MILES ON THE FREEWAY. THEY COULD NEVER GET IT TO ACT UP DOING THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP. THEY CONTACTED GMAC; THE DEALERSHIP AGREED TO FIX THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE ONE OF THE COMPUTERS THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND & JUST WRITE IT OFF SINCE BY THIS POINT THE MILEAGE WAS AT 31,000 BUT THE PROBLEM STARTED WHEN THE MILEAGE WAS AT AROUND 10,000. WHEN I GOT THE CAR BACK IT WAS OCTOBER 2006. I DID NOT HAVE ANYMORE PROBLEMS UNTIL NOVEMBER 2009. I TURNED ON MY VEHICLE & IT DID THE WHOLE THING AGAIN. I TURNED MY VEHICLE OFF & CALLED A DEALERSHIP. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP & THEY KEPT IT FOR A MONTH AND A HALF. WHILE THEY HAD IT I WAS CALLING GMAC TO TRY & GET WHILE THEY HAD IT I WAS CALLING GMAC SINCE THE MILEAGE WAS AT 94,000. WHILE TALKING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT FRANK PARRA DEALERSHIP & GMAC THE COMPUTER WAS NEVER REPLACED; ONLY RELOADED. TO THIS DAY THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN FIXED & IT STILL HAPPENS AT RANDOM.

JUST READING ABOUT 10 COMPLAINTS, SOMEONE HAD WRECKED AND HAD PICTURES POSTED ON COMPLAINT.  FOUND A PARENT ON U TUBE (THAT'S WHERE I GOT THIS WEB SITE) WHO WAS TELLING OTHER OWNERS TO COMPLAIN SO THAT GM WOULD HAVE TO FIX STEERING PROBLEM.  I'M NOT A GENIUS, BUT SEEMS LIKE IF THERE ARE THIS MANY COMPLAINTS AND I ONLY STARTED LOOKING TODAY ON INTERNET, THAT GM WOULD HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THERE IS A PROBLEM AND RECALL THESE VEHICLES AND FIX THE PROBLEM.

THIS HAS OCCURRED BEFORE, RESULTING IN HAVING THE WHOLE MECHANISM REPLACE IN NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOW IT APPEARS THAT IT MAY HAVE TO BE REPLACED AGAIN. WHEN YOU PUT THE CAR IN PARK, IT DOES NOT GO ALL THE WAY INTO GEAR AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP PUTTING THE GEAR FROM NEUTRAL TO PARK UNTIL IT RELEASE THE IGNITION. *TR',\n",

IN JAN 2010 I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY AT 50 MILES AN HOUR WHEN A CHIME SOUNDED AND THE CONSOLE FLASHED POWER STEERING . I DID NOT FEEL MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE CAR AT THAT TIME . THIS NEXT HAPPENED 2 DAYS LATER. IT SEEMED THAT TURNING THE CAR OFF  WOULD RECTIFY THE PROBLEM.  WITH IN THE MONTH, THE CAR WAS EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEM ON EACH DRIVE I TOOK WITH IN THE FIRST 15 MIN. I HAD A PROBLEM WHILE IN THE SCHOOL CAR PARK THAT IT FAILED AND I LOST ALL CONTROL I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR WITH THE BRAKES. ALMOST HITTING A SMALL CHILD AND THE CAR MOUNTING THE CURB AS I WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE WHEELS.  I CONTACTED GM IN LATE FEBRUARY WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AND WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM IS NOT SOMETHING THEY ARE AWARE OF AND THAT MAYBE A PATCH ON ICE CAUSED THE LOSS OF CONTROL. IT WAS THE FOLLOWING DAY THAT WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 50 MILES AN HOUR THE CHIME SOUNDED AND THE CONSOLE FLASHED POWER STEERING . THE CAR LOST ALL POWER. IT DID NOT STALL OR RUN OUT OF GAS IT QUICK WORKING . I WAS UNABLE TO GET THE CAR TO RESTART. I WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE OF TRAFFIC AND WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE HARD SHOULDER. THE CAR WOULD NOT START FOR OVER AN HOUR . WHEN THE CAR STARTED I RETURNED HOME . I HAD A MECHANIC LOOK OVER THE VEHICLE WHILE IT WAS WORKING AND NO PROBLEM OTHER THAN THE FAILURE OF THE POWER STEERING COULD BE FOUND . THE CAR HAS LOST ALL POWER AND SHUT DOWN WITH IN 5 MINS OF THE CAR RUNNING . THE CAR WILL NOT START . IT WILL BE DAYS BEFORE THE START. IT NOW WHEN IT STARTS,THE CHIME SOUNDS AND FLASH POWER STEERING FLASHES AND THE CAR SHUTS DOWN . THIS IS AN UNSAFE CAR . THE PROBLEM IS SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING .

MY SISTER WAS DRIVING THE CAR AND SHE WAS LIKE YOU NEED TO GET THIS FIXED BEFORE YOU HAVE A WRECK OR SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS. I'M LIKE I CANT GET IT FIXED THE WARRANTY HAS RAN OUT ON THE CAR.  THEN I WOULD TURN THE CAR OFF AND TURN IT BACK ON AND IT WOULD WORK FINE. THEN ON ONE OCCASION ME AND MY 2 FRIENDS WAS GOING SHOPPING AND I LET HER DRIVE MY CAR AND WE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION WHEN SHE ADJUSTED THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE CAR SHUT COMPLETELY OFF ON US WHILE GOING DOWN THE INTERSECTION CARS WERE EVERYWHERE AROUND US. ALL THE GAUGES WENT DOWN ALL THE LIGHT WENT OFF EVERYTHING JUST CUT OFF AND SHUT DOWN SO WE LET IT COAST TO THE GAS STATION THAT WAS ON OUR RIGHT WE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING THE STEERING WHEEL WAS HARD SO IT TOOK 2 OF US TO TURN IT. I THINK THAT SOMETHING IN THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM HAS A SHORT IN IT OR IS FELLING BECAUSE MY LIGHTS WHEN I PUT IT IN GEAR OR OUT OF GEAR THE LIGHT DIM ON ME AND THEN MY POWER LOCKS DON'T WORK SO I CANT LOCK MY CAR ANY TIME I WANT TO. THE LOCKS SOMETIMES YOU CAN HEAR THEM GOING UP AND DOWN IN THE CAR. MY CAR GOT BROKEN INTO THE OTHER NIGHT AND I HAVE A POLICE REPORT FOR THAT BECAUSE MY LOCKS DID DON'T WORK THERE FOR SOMEBODY GOT IN MY CAR AND STOLE SOMETHING FROM ME. IF MY LOCKS WOULD NOT KEEP GOING UP AND DOWN THEN I COULD KEEP MY CAR LOCKED. BUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO MY LIGHT ON MY GEAR SHIFT JUST QUIT WORKING. I HAVE TO LIKE TAP ON IT OR PUT THE GEAR SHIFT UP IN PARK THEN BACK DOWN TO DRIVE FOR IT TO COME ON AND THEN IT WILL GO RIGHT BACK OFF.

       "  'Summary': \"IN OCTOBER 2008 WHILE DRIVING 15 MPH MY 2005 CHEVY COBALT HAD A POWER STEERING FAILURE WHICH ALMOST CAUSED A COLLISION WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE JUMPED A CURB, LUCKILY NO ONE WAS HURT.   THERE WAS ONLY 41 ,223 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  I HAD TO TOW THE VEHICLE TO A GM CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY INFORMED ME THAT I HAD TO PAY $773.81 TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN, BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  ON MARCH 3,  2010 AFTER HAVING ACCUMULATED 62,522 MILES DRIVEN ON MY VEHICLE.  I  WHILE DRIVING TO THE STORE, STARTED HAVING STEERING PROBLEMS. I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WAS BECOMING DIFFICULT TO TURN.  THEN I BECAME AWARE (WHILE WATCHING THE NEWS THAT NIGHT ) THAT A RECALL ON THE ELECTRIC STEERING MOTORS FOR 2005 CHEVY COBALTS WAS ISSUED. I CONTACTED GM CHEVROLET BUT WAS TOLD I HAD TO WAIT TO RECEIVE A RECALL LETTER ON MY VEHICLE. I INFORMED GM CHEVROLET OF MY PREVIOUS STEERING PROBLEM IN 2008, BUT WAS OFFERED LITTLE ASSISTANCE.  I WAS INFORMED THAT IF I WANTED THE VEHICLE INSPECTED I WOULD HAVE TO PAY A DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY  REPAIRS PERFORMED.  I  WAS MADE TO WAIT A MONTH FOR A RECALL LETTER. IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK REQUIRING ME TO PAY FOR A DIAGNOSTIC AND REPAIR ON A VEHICLE WHICH HAS A RECALL  IS UNFAIR, CONSIDERING I HAD A PREVIOUS PROBLEM STEERING IN 2008, BEFORE A RECALL WAS ISSUED.  I RECEIVED THE RECALL LETTER YESTERDAY, AND HAD THE VEHICLE REPAIRED TODAY, BUT I COULDN'T DRIVE THE VEHICLE FOR THE LAST MONTH, BECAUSE OF THE STEERING PROBLEM. NOW THEY ARE STATING THAT THEY WILL NOT REIMBURSE ME FOR THE ORIGINAL REPAIR THAT WAS DONE ON 10/30/2008, EVEN THOUGH ANOTHER GM DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE SAME PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH IN 2008 THEY REPLACED THE WHOLE STEERING COLUMNS WHICH WAS THE NORM, BUT NOW THE ARE CORRECTING THE STEERING PROBLEMS BY REPLACING THE ELECTRIC STEERING MOTOR. *TR\",\n",

       " 'Summary': \"I CURRENTLY OWN A 2005 CHEVY COBALT, AND UP UNTIL NOW, I HAVE BEEN PRETTY SATISFIED.  HOWEVER, RECENTLY SINCE I HAVE HIT OVER 60,000 MILES, MY POWER STEERING LIGHT COMES ON AND THEN I LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE WHEEL IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN.  THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO WRECK ON 4 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  WHEN I TURN THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON, IT GOES AWAY FOR AWHILE, BUT THEN ALWAYS SEEMS TO LOCK BACK UP AGAIN.  YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE ONLY THING YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IS ADD POWER STEERING FLUID, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS CAR DOESN'T HAVE THAT, IT IS ALL ELECTRICAL. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND HAVE NOTICED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THERE ARE IN FACT HUNDREDS, IF NOT MORE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRING.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS AND COSTLY PROBLEM($700-$1500), AND OF COURSE I'M NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY ANYMORE, ALONG WITH ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM.  I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HEADLIGHTS CAN BE RECALLED, BUT SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS YOUR STEERING NOT.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE OVER A FAULTY ELECTRIC POWER STEERING PROBLEM.  I HAVE CALLED A FEW DEALERSHIPS IN MY AREA AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAVE SAID THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASES EXACTLY LIKE MINE, IF THEY NOTICE THIS DEFECT, THEN WHY CAN'T THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE DECISION TO RECALL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. *TR\",\n",

THE BSM ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WORKS VERY WELL. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO 2018 COROLLA'S AND ALSO THE HIGHLANDER.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS SINCE THE SYSTEM DOES NOT SHOW A LARGE VEHICLE IN YOUR BLINDSPOT AS ADVERTISED AND COULD LEAD TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I PRESENTED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF TOYOTA VIDEO FILES SUBSTANTIATING BY CONCERNS AND THE IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR A TOYOTA CORPORATION FTS WHO REQUESTED MY VEHICLE FOR THEIR REVIEW.  THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THEY DID INDEED REPLICATE THE FAILURE MODE WITH THE TOYOTA CORPORATION REPRESENTATIVE BUT THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AS DESIGNED!  SO TOYOTA HAS A BSM THAT WILL NOT SENSE A SEMI-TRUCK IN YOUR BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BUT WILL ON THE DRIVE SIDE. I PERCEIVE THAT TO BE A PROTECT TOYOTA LIABILITY RESPONSE NOT A SAFETY ISSUE FOCUS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I HAVE SEVERAL VIDEO FILES DOCUMENTING THE BSM NOT WORKING WHICH I WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE.  THE FILES ARE MOV FORMAT AND NOT A FORMAT LISTED AS UPLOAD ABLE IN YOUR SYSTEM.\\r\\n\\r\\n  THE BSM MONITOR HAS NOT WORKED APPROPRIATELY SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE MARCH 8, 2018.

I HAD THE VISOR CLOSED ON THE MOONROOF SO NO GLASS ENTERED THE CABIN.  THE ENTIRE MOONROOF SHATTERED AND THERE WAS A HOLE TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE MOONROOF.  IT WAS A CLEAR DAY AND THE PAVEMENT WAS LEVEL.  I DID NOT SEE ANY OBJECTS FROM THE ROAD APPROACH MY CAR PRIOR TO THE MOONROOF SHATTERING.  LATER THAT DAY I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY CAR DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT LOOKED LIKE AN IMPACT HAD CAUSED THE MOONROOF TO SHATTER.  I HAD THE MOONROOF REPAIRED BY THE DEALER AT A COST OF $968.  I LEARNED FROM RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF SHATTERING SUNROOFS/MOONROOFS INVOLVING MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS.  I REPORTED THE SITUATION TO TOYOTA\\'S NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER.  I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE MOONROOF CAN SHATTER ON THE SUNROOF WHEN I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT TYPE OF DAMAGE AND THAT I WAS AWARE THAT TOYOTA AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS HAD EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH SUNROOFS/MOONROOFS.  I PROVIDED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE MOONROOF.  AFTER INITIAL BEING TOLD THAT MY SITUATION WOULD BE HANDLED AT NO CHARGE TO ME, I WAS DIRECTED TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WHO I WAS TOLD WAS SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS.  THAT REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED ME THAT THE MOONROOF SHATTERING WAS CAUSED BY AN \"OUTSIDE INFLUENCE\" AND THAT TOYOTA WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THE MOONROOF.  HE FURTHER ADVISED THAT THERE WAS NO \"PROGRAM\" IN EXISTENCE THAT WOULD ALLOW MY VERHICLE TO REPAIRED AT NO CHARGE TO ME.  I ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE IF TOYOTA\\'S POSITION WAS THAT THE MOONROOF WAS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY WHEN IT SHATTERED BASED ON SOME UNKNOWN AND UNDEFINED \"OUTSIDE INFLUENCE\" AND I WAS THAT IT WAS NOT THE CASE.',\n",
